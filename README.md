# bspwm
This is my personal configuration of bspwm but I wanted to make it an
easy one stop setup for anyone so that they don't have to jump through
hoops to setup bspwm like I had too. It also centralizes all of the
configuration files in one directory making it easier to make changes
as well as using the git repositories of bspwm and other programs as
submodules.

Supported Distros:
- Ubuntu
- Arch

If you want others supported please put in a PR or an issue
