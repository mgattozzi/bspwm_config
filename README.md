# bspwm
This is my personal configuration of bspwm but I wanted to make it an
easy one stop setup for anyone so that they don't have to jump through
hoops to setup bspwm like I had too. It also centralizes all of the
configuration files in one directory making it easier to make changes
as well as using the git repositories of bspwm and other programs as
submodules.

# Installation

This script assumes you have all of the needed dev packages installed
until I change the script

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mgattozzi/bspwm_config.git
cd bspwm_config
./install.sh
```
